## Which member type and which bike types are most popular? 

According to the Types sheet and Direction 2 on our Direction Dashboard, most riders are members, classic bikes are the most popular type of bike, electric bikes are the second most popular, and docked bikes are the least popular. 

## What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?

The peak hours when bikes are used during the month of May are 8 AM and 5-6 PM. This is presumably because people are going to work at these times. 

## What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

Taking Distance 2 on our Distance Dashboard into consideration, we estimate that the average distance for a bike trip at about 0.5 mile. 

## Are electric bikes more popular in the evening when people are tired and coming home from work?
<!-- 8 AM: 0.12481 -->
<!-- 5 PM: 0.15093 -->
Ignoring docked bikes because there were so few rides using them, the ratio of electric bikes to classic bikes at 8 AM was 0.125. At 5 PM, this ratio is 0.151, so electric bikes were more popular at 5 PM. 

## Do people typically use Citibikes twiceâ€”once on a trip going in one direction and again on a trip going in the opposite direction? 

The number of trips headed northwest and southeast were about the same, but Direction 2 on our Direction Dashboard tells us that there were more rides traveling southwest than rides traveling northeast. According to [this NYC Borough Populations site](https://www.citypopulation.de/en/usa/newyorkcity/), we may partially attribute this to the fact that Brooklyn has a greater population than Queens and that Manhattan has a greater population than the Bronx. 

## Are there many outliers in terms of distance? 

According to our estimates of each ride's distance and to Direction 1 on our Direction Dashboard, there are relatively few outliers in terms of distance. Riders mostly travel about the same distance. Additionally, in Distance 1, we did find that most outliers in terms of distance were rides traveling northeast and southwest. 

## How does the average trip duration change by the type of user?  

According to our Trip Length sheet, member and casual users had about the same number of trips from lengths of 0.2 hours to lengths greater than 1 hour, but there were many more trips of a length less than 0.2 hour for members, so the average trip distance for members is much lower.
