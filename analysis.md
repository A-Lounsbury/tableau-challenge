Design **2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total)**. You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
The following are questions you may wish to answer. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!
*	**What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?**
The peak hours when bikes are used during the month of May are 8 AM and 5-6 PM. This is presumably because people are going to work at these times. 
*	**Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?**
*	**Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?**
*	**Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?**
*	**Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?**
*	**How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from).**
*	**What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?**

*	**What is the ratio of day trips that start and end in the same day to overnight trips that start on one day and end on the next?** 
*	**What hours are Citibikes used the most? Are electric bikes more popular in the evening when people are coming home from work?**
*	**Do people typically use Citibikes twice—once on a trip going in one direction and again on a trip going in the opposite direction?** \

*	**Are there many outliers in terms of distance?**
